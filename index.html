			<h2>Travel ‚úàÔ∏è</h2>
				<p> I like to travel a lot. When I was younger, I had the opportunity to discover European countries such as Greece or Spain. I also had the opportunity to go and study for a semester in Singapore. These experiences allowed me to improve my English, but also to discover new cultures and traditions. Soon I will be leaving for Sydney for a second semester abroad.  I am looking forward to discovering a new country at the end of the world... And maybe one day I will settle there. </p>

			<h2> Cooking üë©‚Äçüç≥</h2>
				<p> I love to cook, try new recipes and share them with my friends and family. Cooking is for me a convivial moment. I am also more and more interested in nutrition from a health point of view, beyond the fun side of eating good food. I also like to discover new flavors, especially through my travels. </p>

			<h2>Gymnastic ü§∏‚Äç</h2>
				<p> I practiced gymnastics in competition for 10 years. I grew up with this sport and that is why I am particularly attached to it. Beyond a sporting experience, this sport has taught me to have ambition and to always aim higher, and to work to get what I want. Perseverance is a key point in the practice of gymnastics. Unfortunately, I had to stop because of my move for my studies.</p>
